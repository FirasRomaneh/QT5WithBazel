# QT setup for Bazel

This repository contains a simple Qt5 Hello World application with that is
built with [http://bazel.io/](Bazel).

The Bazel setup has been tested on an Arch Linux system with Qt5 installed. It
should work on other OSes, possibly with changes to the WORKSPACE file and the
qt.bzl file that adjust the paths in them.
